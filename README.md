This application uses the weather api found here: https://www.weatherapi.com/api.aspx

A API Key is required and comes with a 2 week trial

To use the app, simply execute main.py which will prompt you for a zip code and whether you want the current weather or the forecast.  Currently, the forecast is hard-coded to 5 days, but this could easily be add as an input.

current.json and forecast.json each contain a copy of the json returned by the functions in weather.py and were used to test the output format
